# Unity 3D Yacht Simulator
I decided to develop my own yacht simulator and want to share my findings of sailing physics and its implementation using the Unity game development platform. Though I read tons of blogs and books regarding ships & water physics there are almost no examples and explanations about sails & wind forces. So, I decided to do the research and post here the results.

Click on the picture to see the video of simulation on YouTube. At the beginning of the video you see the blue and red vectors that presents lift & drag forces. Yellow vectors shows apparent wind angle. Green is the yacht velocity vector.

In this project I would like to implement most important forces requred to simulate the real sailing yacht behavior.
* Apparent wind
* Wind lift & drag forces
* Water buoyancy force
* Hull viscous pressure resistance
* Hull friction resistance
* Keel lift & drag (resistance) forces
* Waves resistance
* Steering rudder lift & drag forces
* Hull air resistance
* Hull lateral resistance
