# Unity 3D Yacht Simulator
I decided to develop my own yacht simulator and want to share my findings of sailing physics and its implementation using the Unity game development platform. Though I read tons of blogs and books regarding ships & water physics there are almost no examples and explanations about sails & wind forces. So, I decided to do the research and post here the results.

[![YouTube video about 3D Yacht Simulator](http://img.youtube.com/vi/0eu_4tyjstk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eu_4tyjstk "3D Yacht Simulator v0.1")

In this project I would like to implement most important forces requred to simulate the real sailing yacht behavior.
* Apparent wind
* Wind lift & drag forces
* Water buoyancy force
* Hull viscous pressure resistance
* Hull friction resistance
* Keel lift & drag (resistance) forces
* Waves resistance
* Steering rudder lift & drag forces
* Hull air resistance
* Hull lateral resistance
